# CYBR473 Assignment 1: Basic Static and Dynamic Analysis
***

## Abstract
Assessment 1 is worth 30% of the overall grade for the course and will involve showing your ability to apply the tools introduced in the course and your ability to carry out basic static and dynamic analysis of malware. You have four weeks to complete this assignment.

## Assignment Goals
It is your job to use malware analysis methods learnt from the lectures to document specific characteristics and behaviours of malware.

## Assignment Components
* Setting up your analysis environment: this is so you can get used to working with VirtualBox. This component is worth 5% of the grade.
* Demo videos: this is to demonstrate what you have learnt by completing labs from practical malware analysis. This component is worth 20% of the grade.
* Written reflection: this individual report requires you to use the tools to creatively investigate a piece of malware. This component is worth 75% of the grade. 

## Demo Video
These labs use the samples from the book. You are allowed to look at the answers because we want you to gain experience with working with the Virtual Machine environment, demonstrate that you can use the tools, and show that you can record a screen-cast showing your lab work.
The labs are designed to run on a Windows XP machine with administrative privileges. Many of the labs will work on Windows Vista or Windows 7, but some will not.
The lab executable binaries are found under the Downloads directory under Practical Malware Analysis Labs.

### Basic Static Analysis
Review Labs 1-1, 1-2, 1-3 and 1-4. The binaries are found under BinaryCollection/Chapter_1L.
Create a demonstration video that shows the following with a voice-over describing any choices you have made when doing the analysis:
- Use of PEview and PEiD to discover the type of packer that was used for Lab01-02.exe

### Basic Dynamic Analysis
Review Labs 3-1, 3-2 (note that the DLL wonâ€™t work in the current build, so just review on paper), 3-3 and 3-4. The binaries are found under BinaryCollection/Chapter_3L.
Create a demonstration video that shows the following with a voice-over describing any choices you have made when doing the analysis:
- Demonstration of the use of Regshot to show changes in the registry when exploring the behaviour of Lab03-04.exe and any other exe that might be useful to demonstrate its usage.
- Use ProcessHacker to show the entry for ProcessCreate when running Lab03-04.exe and what this is showing. 

## Written Report
You will find a zip file malware in the Downloads directory. You should perform basic static and dynamic analysis using the tools demonstrated in the last part of the assignment and any other tools that you have met so far in the course or your research.
Write up your reflections on the following:
* Does the malware match any existing antivirus signatures? 
* Can you download and compare antivirus signatures from say ClamAV? 
* When was this malware compiled? 
* Is this malware packed or obfuscated? If so, how? 
* Are there any files or host-based indicators that could be used to find this malware on infected machines? 
* What could network-based indicators be used to find this malware on infected machines? 
* What type of malware is this? 
* What would you guess is the purpose of this malware? 
* What was your thinking process, and how did you use the tools to answer these questions? 
You should be clear which tools were used and how they were used. Make sure you reference where you can obtain or read more about these tools so that your analysis could be repeated.
